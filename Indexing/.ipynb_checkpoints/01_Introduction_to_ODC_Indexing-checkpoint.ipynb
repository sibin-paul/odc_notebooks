    "# Indexing New Data\n",
    "This notebook mainly covers on the ODC indexing process.\n",
    "\n",
    "ODC uses the concepts of *Product* and *Dataset* to represent the data indexed in its catalog. *Products* are collections of data sets that share the same set of measures and some subsets of metadata. The *Dataset* represents the smallest independently described, inventoried and managed data aggregation. These are usually scenes stored in files that together represent a *Product*.\n",

    "The Data Cube can handle many different types of data, and requires a bit of information up front to know what to do with them. This is the task of a Product Definition.\n",

    "A *Product Definition* provides a short name, a description, some basic source metadata and (optionally) a list of measurements describing the type of data that will be contained in the Datasets of its type. In Landsat Surface Reflectance, for example, the measurements are the list of bands.\n",
    "\n",
    "The measurements is an ordered list of data, which specify a name and some aliases, a data type or dtype, and some options extras including what type of units the measurement is in, a nodata value, and even a way of specifying bit level descriptions or the spectral response in the case of reflectance data.\n",

To automate this process, ODC provides metadata extraction scripts for the following instruments/sensors: Landsat-5/7/8, Sentinel-1/2, ALOS-1/2, ASTER Digital Elevation Model (DEM), and MODIS. With the metadata of the prepared files. \n",
